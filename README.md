Thats a small simple app build with expressJs, and React.
Database: MongoDB
Authorization: JsonWebToken
Frontend: ReactJs
Styling: TailwindCSS

features:
Creating an Account (password hashed with bcrypt)
Logging In
JWT authorization / in localstorage :( /
Adding Pools
Voting in Pools (only once per user!)
Searching for users
Displaying user info, and all pools he created
Dashboard with all pools created by all users

I created that app to train my skills with react, node, express, authorization and mongoDB :)
